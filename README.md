Bone Mineral Density prediction in elderly Analysis
This repository contains an analysis of the L1-4 bone mineral density using various attributes. The main objective is to create a predictive model for bone mineral density.

Data
The data used in this project comes from [He, Linfeng, 2022, "Bone mineral density", https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/UDZIJS, Harvard Dataverse, . 

Note: If the data have privacy restrictions or are too large to be included in the repository, replace the above description with instructions or links to obtain the data.

Analysis
The analysis was conducted using Python and various data science libraries, including pandas, scikit-learn, and seaborn. Different regression models were tested, and the Random Forest Regressor showed the best performance.

Key Findings
The L1-4 bone mineral density has strong correlations with Mg.
The Random Forest model achieved an R^2R 
2
  of approximately 0.9923, indicating a very good fit to the data.
How to Run
Clone this repository.
Install the necessary libraries using pip install -r requirements.txt.
